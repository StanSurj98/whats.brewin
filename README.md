## About
What's Brewin' a centralized platform to discover new breweries. We love beer and travel and wanted to give back to the breweries in all areas giving them a space to be easily discovered. This is our final project for Web Development Program at Lighthouse Labs made possible with the help of <a href="https://www.openbrewerydb.org/"> Open Brewery DB. </a>
